	<h2>Who are we?</h2>
	<p id="indent">
		Cool Greens Tech is an organization that is passionate about changing the world through technology. After learning various programming languages from the <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/summer-immersion-programs/">Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program</a> in 2017 at AT&T in Austin, the five of us decided to help Earth by creating a website that informs the community about Global Warming. We, as a team, created a series of mini games inside a main game to keep viewers interested in learning the contents. On our informations site, we included many interesting facts and current events related to Global Warming. We will never leave our path in trying to help Earth become better! Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> if you have any questions or concerns!

	<h2>What is our mission?</h2>
	<p id="indent">
		Cool Greens Tech would like to alert others and spread awareness about the causes and effects of Global Warming, hopefully lead the world to initiate action to help the environment. It's necessary that Global Warming doesn't get even worse. We hope that our message will reach others' concern for the Earth.

		Anna Yukiko Bickenbach is a co-founder of the web app <a href="http://market.ecosummit.net/c/ecotastic">EcoTastic</a>. This app enables users to track & share their environmentally-friendly behavior. Users can simply take a picture of their environmentally-friendly action with the app, describe it then send it off. Other users rate whether or not the activity was environmentally-friendly, and the calculated average is added to the original user’s account. The user can collect points through taking action to sustain the environment, rating other user’s actions, being at the top of the weekly ranking list and much more.

		Her work relates to our project a lot, as we want our web app to encourage users to keep environment-friendly habits as well.
